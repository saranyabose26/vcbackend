Note:-
    Everything work perfectly in local system. But when I deploy my code in render.com some features or not working

    Eg:- node-schedule is not working in the appointment booking api. The problem is because of I am using a free instance in render.com If my application is inactive for several minutes the server will go to sleep so that's the problem. So I have commented the particular code.
